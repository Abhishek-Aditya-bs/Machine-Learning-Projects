# Churn Modelling using Artificial Neural Network

It is no secret that customer retention is a top priority for many companies;
acquiring new customers can be several times more expensive than retaining existing ones. Furthermore, gaining an understanding of the reasons customers churn and estimating the risk associated with individual customers are both powerful components of designing a data-driven retention strategy. A churn model can be the tool that brings these elements together and provides insights and outputs that drive decision making across an organization.

churn rate is calculated by dividing the number of customer cancellations within a time period by the number of active customers at the start of that period. Very valuable insights can be gathered from this simple analysis â€” for example, the overall churn rate can provide a benchmark against which to measure the impact of a model. And knowing how churn rate varies by time of the week or month, product line, or customer cohort can help inform simple customer segments for targeting as well.
However, churn is often needed at more granular customer level. Customers vary in their behaviors and preferences, which in turn influence their satisfaction or desire to cancel service. Therefore, a cohort-based churn rate may not be enough for precise targeting or real-time risk prediction. This is where churn modeling is usually most useful.
The output of a predictive churn model is a measure of the immediate or future risk of a customer cancellation. This is what the term "churn modeling" most often refers to.

So we will build a Artificial Neural Network using Tensorflow to predict whether a customer of the bank will leave the bank or not.
