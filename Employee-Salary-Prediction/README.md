Predicting the salary of employees based on his position in the company using Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Random Forest Regression.

Based on the visualization of the graphs and the predicted results we see that Random forest Regression with number of trees in the forest i.e. `n_estimators = 10` performs better than Support Vector Regression for the particular Data Set.
