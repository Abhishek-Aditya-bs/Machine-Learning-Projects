# Market Basket Optimization using Association Rule Learning

In a store, all vegetables are placed in the same aisle, all dairy items are placed together and cosmetics form another set of such groups. Investing time and resources on deliberate product placements like this not only reduces a customer’s shopping time, but also reminds the customer of what relevant items (s)he might be interested in buying, thus helping stores cross-sell in the process. Association rules help uncover all such relationships between items from huge databases.

Rules do not extract an individual’s preference, rather find relationships between set of elements of every distinct transaction. This is what makes them different from collaborative filtering.Rules do not tie back a users’ different transactions over time to identify relationships. List of items with unique transaction IDs (from all users) are studied as one group. This is helpful in placement of products on aisles, in recommending items on e-commerce websites.

So Identifying the best deals can maximize the sales and profit.
