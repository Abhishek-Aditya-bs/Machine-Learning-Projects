# Clustering using K-means and Hierarchial clustering methods

The data set contains the survey information of customers of the mall. It contains CustomerID, Genre, Age, Annual Income (k$), Spending Score (1-100).

Since this is unsupervised learning we are not predicting anything but instead based on this information we will be clustering them into 5 differnt types of clusters which are then visualized in the notebook.
